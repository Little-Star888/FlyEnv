## Need New Project Name

Thank you to all those who have followed and used the project.

In the early stages of the project, the main focus was on PHP related features. Up to now, a lot of new features and language support have been added. It's not just PHP anymore. So the project needs a new name.

Please help me choose a new name based on your understanding of the project. Thank

## ‚å®Ô∏è Development

### Cloning Code

```bash
git clone git@github.com:xpf0000/PhpWebStudy.git
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
cd PhpWebStudy
yarn install
```

### Run

```bash
yarn run dev
```

### Build

```bash
yarn run build
```

### PHP Versions

The brew libraries do not support older PHP versions, so if you want to use an older version of PHP, you need to use one of brew's third-party libraries.
Example:

[shivammathur/php](https://github.com/shivammathur/homebrew-php)

[phpbrew/phpbrew](https://github.com/phpbrew/phpbrew)

This application uses shivammathur/php, by default it will automatically add shivammathur/php libraries to the brew, but due to 'network problems', it may fail to add them.
You can add it by yourself, add command.

```
brew tap shivammathur/php
```
