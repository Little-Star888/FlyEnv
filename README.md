## üíΩ Installation

1. [GitHub](https://github.com/xpf0000/PhpWebStudy/releases) provides the compiled stable version of the installation package

The latest version of the intel and Apple M installer has been separated, with arm64 for Apple M, without for intel, pay attention not to download the wrong one!

2. Installation with brew

```
brew install phpwebstudy
```

3. Of course you can also clone the code yourself to compile and package it.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Development

### Cloning Code

```bash
git clone git@github.com:xpf0000/PhpWebStudy.git
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
cd PhpWebStudy
yarn install
```

### Run

```bash
yarn run dev
```

### Build

```bash
yarn run build
```

### PHP Versions

The brew libraries do not support older PHP versions, so if you want to use an older version of PHP, you need to use one of brew's third-party libraries.
Example:

[shivammathur/php](https://github.com/shivammathur/homebrew-php)

[phpbrew/phpbrew](https://github.com/phpbrew/phpbrew)

This application uses shivammathur/php, by default it will automatically add shivammathur/php libraries to the brew, but due to 'network problems', it may fail to add them.
You can add it by yourself, add command.

```
brew tap shivammathur/php
```

### PHP extensions

Current one-click installs include: ionCube memcache memcached redis swoole xdebug ssh2 pdo_sqlsrv imagick mongodb yaf sg11

For those that are not added to the one-click install, install them as follows and replace them with your own version of PHP.

```bash
cd extensions dir
/usr/local/Cellar/php@7.2.34/7.2.34/bin/phpize
./configure --with-php-config=/usr/local/Cellar/php@7.2.34/7.2.34/bin/php-config
make
make install
```
